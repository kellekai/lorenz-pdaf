# what's this?

Lorenz models 96 and 63 (parallelized) with PDAF - EnKF filter

Implementation uses the offline mode of PDAF and restart files for assimilation and model updates

observations are created on the fly

initial ensemble generated by:

EnsembleState_i = InitState + r, r = N(0,sigma)

EnsembleState_i -> i-th ensemble state  

InitState -> init state defined beforehand (e.g. [0,0,0.1,0,0,...], zero with small perturbation)
